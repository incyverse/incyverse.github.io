# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values which you are expected to set up once and
# rarely edit after that. If you find yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files feature
# for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you
# change this file, please restart the server process.
#
# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files, you will see them accessed via
# {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible in the templates via
# {{ site.myvariable }}.
